# FlowLang Production Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Language Extensions (Weeks 1-4)

### 1.1 Data Structures
- [ ] Arrays/Lists: `let arr be [1, 2, 3]`

- [ ] Array indexing: `arr[0]`, `map["key"]`
- [ ] Array methods: `push`, `pop`, `length`, `slice`

### 1.2 Enhanced Functions
- [ ] Default parameters: `def func with x, y = 10 do`

- [ ] Closures and lexical scoping

### 1.3 Module System
- [ ] Module imports: `import math from "std/math"`
- [ ] Module exports: `export def add with x, y do`
- [ ] Relative imports: `import utils from "./utils"`
- [ ] Standard library modules

### 1.4 Error Handling

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Phase 1)
1. Arrays and hash maps - essential for any real program
2. Module system - enables code organization
3. Enhanced error handling - production requirement
4. File I/O operations - basic system interaction

### Critical (Phase 2)
1. Bytecode VM - independence from Rust
2. Garbage collection - memory safety
3. Standard library foundation

### Important (Phases 3-4)
1. Comprehensive standard library
2. Development tooling
3. Package management

### Advanced (Phases 5-6)
1. Performance optimization
2. Self-hosting capability
3. Native compilation

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Can build and run FlowLang programs without Rust
- [ ] Performance within 2x of equivalent Python programs
- [ ] Complete standard library covering 80% of common use cases
- [ ] IDE support with syntax highlighting and debugging
- [ ] Package ecosystem with at least 50 community packages
- [ ] Self-hosting: FlowLang compiler written in FlowLang
- [ ] Production deployment: At least 3 real-world applications

## Getting Started

To begin Phase 1, we'll start with implementing arrays and hash maps as they're fundamental to most programming tasks.
